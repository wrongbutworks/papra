### Patch Changes

- [#1312](https://github.com/papra-hq/papra/pull/1312) [`aded832`](https://github.com/papra-hq/papra/commit/aded8322985b945b3e3776dd7031852be20cb093) Thanks [@CorentinTh](https://github.com/CorentinTh)! - Greatly improved the performances when updating and deleting document from the sezarch index, avoiding unnecessary table scans. Noticeable improvement on large document collections (10k+ documents).

- [#1313](https://github.com/papra-hq/papra/pull/1313) [`94f2a68`](https://github.com/papra-hq/papra/commit/94f2a683c1fdb543dd84d8541a4ea70b291471f5) Thanks [@CorentinTh](https://github.com/CorentinTh)! - Added visual loading state to the rename document modal.

Now correctly converts the string to a number, preventing the validation error.

- [#1320](https://github.com/papra-hq/papra/pull/1320) [`2ef3148`](https://github.com/papra-hq/papra/commit/2ef314835ee380869dd28d9924737ae86eaf8602) Thanks [@CorentinTh](https://github.com/CorentinTh)! - Fix auto tagging schema definition for some ai providers (notably OpenAI and Anthropic), as they do not support all JSON schema features. It's really nice to have a common spec, if only all providers respected it...

- [#1323](https://github.com/papra-hq/papra/pull/1323) [`74d98b2`](https://github.com/papra-hq/papra/commit/74d98b2317e88c3d52389d472279c7fb049927df) Thanks [@CorentinTh](https://github.com/CorentinTh)! - Added better logging when an error occurs during the structured data generation.

  - Custom HTTP endpoint (configurable)
  - Internal Papra extraction engine (default)

  - `INGESTION_FOLDER_WATCHER_FILE_STABILITY_THRESHOLD_MS`: The amount of time in milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before being consumed. This helps to avoid processing files that are still being written to (e.g., scanners, cameras, network shares, etc.).

## 26.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#993](https://github.com/papra-hq/papra/pull/993) [`17b501a`](https://github.com/papra-hq/papra/commit/17b501a9968591db5ca7f36c850c1662ee3c2fdf) Thanks [@CorentinTh](https://github.com/CorentinTh)! - **Breaking change regarding webhook URLs**

  Added SSRF protection for webhook URLs. Webhook URLs are now validated to ensure they do not point to private or reserved IP addresses, preventing potential server-side request forgery attacks.
  So webhooks pointing to private IPs (e.g. `http://192.168.0.1/some/stuff`), or with domains resolving to private IPs (e.g. `http://myservice.local/some/stuff`) will be blocked unless explicitly allowed.

  Two new configuration options are available:
  - `WEBHOOK_SSRF_PROTECTION_ENABLED` Set to `false` to fully disable SSRF protection. This is not recommended, prefer using the allowlist below instead.
  - `WEBHOOK_URL_ALLOWED_HOSTNAMES` A comma-separated list of hostnames (IP addresses or domain names) that are explicitly trusted and exempt from SSRF checks (e.g. internal services you control).

  The new `/api/organizations/:organizationId/documents` endpoint now behave as the old `/search` endpoint, with all documents being returned when `searchQuery` is empty. Note that the response field `totalCount` of the old `/search` endpoint has been renamed to `documentsCount` in the new endpoint.

  Before:

  ```
  GET /api/organizations/:organizationId/documents/search?searchQuery=invoice&pageIndex=1&pageSize=20
  Response: {
    documents: Document[];
    totalCount: number;
  }

  GET /api/organizations/:organizationId/documents?pageIndex=1&pageSize=20
